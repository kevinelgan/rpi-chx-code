Report digital (numeric) value from a Raspberry Pi 3 photoresistor.

I'm using the C version for this because the equivalent Python code did not work.

See also:

* Original C source code [here](https://github.com/adeept/Adeept_Starter_Kit_C_Code_for_RPi/blob/master/11_photoresistance/photoresistor.c).
* `~/sync/joint/raspberry_pi/Adeept_Starter_Kit_for_RPi3_V2.0/Adeept_Starter_Kit_for_RPi_User_Manual.pdf` - This PDF contains the circuit diagram and photos (see "Lesson 10 Photoresistor" on page 46).
* `~/sync/joint/raspberry_pi/experiments/Adeept-Projects/lesson-10-photoresistor` - I moved my original version here because I didn't want it cluttering up this repository (which now only contains active/in-use source code, docs, diagrams, config files, and build scripts).
